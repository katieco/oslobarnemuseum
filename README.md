# Site of Oslo Children's Museum

This is the space for developing the new web site of Oslo Children's Museum, with open sources and Jekyll as site generator. The site should initially be Norwegian, to then become multilingual.

Alpha (new) site, based on this repository:

#### https://katieco.github.io/oslobarnemuseum/

Current (old) site: http://www.oslobarnemuseum.org


#### Requirements:

Overall goal of the site is to serve both users and backers.   
Communicate that it isn't a singular place, but often at Sentralen. Dual: Both at festivals and Sentralen.
Partner logos above the fold. Give space to archive a bunch of accumulated information since the museum started in 2005.
