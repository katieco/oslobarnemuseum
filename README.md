## https://katieco.github.io/oslobarnemuseum/

Site of the Oslo Children's Museum. This is the space for developing the new web site of Oslo Children's Museum, with open sources and Jekyll as site generator. The site should initially be Norwegian, to then become multilingual.
 
Current (old) site: http://www.oslobarnemuseum.org

#### Requirements:

Overall goal of the site is to serve both users and backers.   
Communicate that it isn't a singular place, but often at Sentralen. Dual: Both at festivals and Sentralen.
Partner logos above the fold. Give space to archive a bunch of accumulated information since the museum started in 2005 - Blog and categorizations.

## 

The Oslo ChildrenÂ´s museum gratefully welcomes contributions. The same way one adds to the blog, branch off, make something great and get it pulled into master branch. 

## Add or edit blog posts

Create a branch, add or edit Markdown files (.md) in the folder [posts folder](https://github.com/katieco/oslobarnemuseum/tree/master/_posts). Commit and file a pull request to get the branch merged with master.
