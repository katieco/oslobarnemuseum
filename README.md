# Site of Oslo Children's Museum

This is a space for developing the new web site of Oslo Children's Museum with open sources and Jekyll as site generator.
The site should initally be in Norwegian, to then become multilingual.

Alpha site from this repository: https://katieco.github.io/oslobarnemuseum/
Current site: www.oslobarnemuseum.org


Requirements:
Overall goal of the site is to serve both users and backers.   
Communicate that it isn't a singular place, but often at Sentralen. Dual: Both at festivals and Sentralen.
Partner logos above the fold. Give space to archive a bunch of accumulated information since.
